## 📘 What is this project?

This is an "AI-powered interview practice tool" that acts like your "personal interview trainer".

It:
- Asks you "real interview questions".

This project is built using **IBM Cloud tools** and *AI models*, and it's especially helpful for:

❓ Why did I build this?

Many students and job seekers feel confused before interviews.  
They don’t know:
- What kind of questions will be asked?
- How to answer them?
- How to improve communication and confidence?

So I created a **smart AI Agent** that:
- Understands your resume or job role
- Creates **custom questions**
- Acts like a **virtual HR**
- Gives **personalized suggestions** to improve


💡 Main Features

✅ **Answer Feedback** — Real-time suggestions using AI  
✅ **Soft Skill Analysis** — How you speak and present yourself  
✅ **Resume Scanner** — Finds strengths and improvement areas  
✅ **Natural Chat Experience** — Like talking to a real HR  
✅ **Scalable** — Hosted on IBM Cloud, works anywhere  
✅ **Progress Tracking** — Helps you grow over time  
✅ **Future Ready** — Voice support, multiple languages, emotion detection coming soon!
